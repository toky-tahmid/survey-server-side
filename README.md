Q:Create a readme with what challenges you have faced for the backend?

Ans:-Firstly faced error connecting to the mongodb.Then unfortunately I have set .env for secure but in that the user and the password names are not matched then i have faced an error.i didn't structure the files all are in the index.js file so when i needed a api then it took some time to find the exact api. when have only one amount so i have to set it manually then i faced some issues to find out how to set it properly.these problems i have faced in the backend.
